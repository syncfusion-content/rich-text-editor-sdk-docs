# Getting Started with the React Block Editor Component

This section explains how to create a simple Block Editor and configure its available functionalities in the React environment.

## Create a React Application

Run the following commands to set up a React application:

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-app -- --template react-ts
```

This command prompts you to configure the React application. Select the options as shown below.

As Syncfusion packages are not installed yet, currently, the `No` option will be selected. Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using the following commands:

```
cd my-app
npm install
```

> **Note:** To set up a React application with Nextjs or Remix, refer to this [documentation](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/getting-started/quick-start) for more details.

## Adding Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Block Editor Packages

All available Essential<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> JS 2 packages are published in the [`npmjs.com`](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg) public registry.

To install the Block Editor component package, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-react-blockeditor --save
```

## Adding a CSS Reference

Syncfusion provides multiple themes for the Block Editor component. For a complete list of available themes, refer to the [themes packages](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/appearance/theme#theme-packages).

To install the [tailwind3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme) theme package, use the following command:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme --save
```

Import the required CSS theme files for the Block Editor and its dependencies in your `src/App.css` file.

```css
@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-tailwind3-theme/styles/blockeditor/index.css';
```
I> To apply the application-specific styles correctly, import **App.css** into **src/App.tsx** and remove all the default styles from **src/index.css**.

## Add the Block Editor Component

Now, You can add the Block Editor component to your application. Replace the default contents of `src/App.tsx` with the following code, which uses the `<BlockEditorComponent>` directive to render the editor.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="App.tsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor-sdk/react/block-editor/getting-started/app/App.tsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight js tabtitle="App.jsx" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor-sdk/react/block-editor/getting-started/app/App.jsx %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight css tabtitle="App.css" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor-sdk/react/block-editor/getting-started/app/App.css %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

> **Note:** This guide assumes React 18+. The Vite template mounts the app into a `<div id="root">` element in `index.html` via `src/main.tsx` using `createRoot`. Ensure your `main.tsx` renders the `App` component into that node.

## Run the application

Now, run the `npm run dev` command in your terminal to start the development server.

```
npm run dev
```
