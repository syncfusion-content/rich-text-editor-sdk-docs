# Undo redo in React Block Editor component

The undo/redo feature in Block Editor enables users to revert or reapply changes made to the content, offering a safety net for edits and enhancing the overall editing experience.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Action | Windows | Mac | Description |
|------------|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| Undo       | Ctrl + Z     | ⌘ + Z   | Reverts the last action. |
| Redo       | Ctrl + Y     | ⌘ + Y | Reapplies the last undone action. |

## Configuring Undo/Redo stack

The Block Editor stores a history of actions, allowing users to perform undo and redo operations. By default, it saves up to `30` actions. You can customize this limit using the [undoRedoStack](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/react/documentation/api/blockeditor/index-default#undoredostack) property to control the maximum number of steps that can be undone or redone.

The example below sets the undo/redo history limit to `20` actions.
