# Feature Modules in React Rich Text Editor

The [Vue Rich Text Editor](https://www.syncfusion.com/rich-text-editor-sdk/vue-rich-text-editor) component follows a modular architecture, enabling users to include or exclude features as needed to ensure optimal performance and customization.

## What is a module in Vue Rich Text Editor?

In the Vue Rich Text Editor, a module refers to a self-contained feature or functionality that can be selectively enabled or disabled. These modules are provided as part of the @syncfusion/ej2-vue-richtexteditor package and can be injected to extend the editor's capabilities.

For example, modules such as `Toolbar`, `Link`, `Image`, `HtmlEditor`, and `QuickToolbar` enable specific tools and behavior in the Rich Text Editor interface.

## How to import and inject modules

To use a module in the Vue Rich Text Editor, you must:

* Import the required module from the Syncfusion package.

* Inject it using the provider section and use `richtexteditor` as a key.

The following example demonstrates how to import and inject modules.

{% tabs %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Composition API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor-sdk/vue/rich-text-editor/getting-started-cs1/app-composition.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% highlight html tabtitle="Options API (~/src/App.vue)" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor-sdk/vue/rich-text-editor/getting-started-cs1/app.vue %}
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}
        
{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/code-snippet/rich-text-editor-sdk/vue/rich-text-editor/getting-started-cs1" %}
