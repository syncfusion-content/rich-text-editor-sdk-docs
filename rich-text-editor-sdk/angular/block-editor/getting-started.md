# Getting Started with Angular Block Editor

This guide explains how to add the Syncfusion Block Editor component to a new Angular application. The result is a fully wired, empty editor that renders with the default theme; you can then load blocks through the `blocks` property or the [API methods](./methods.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following are installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later) — required by the Angular CLI.
- **Angular CLI** (v14 or later) — required for the standalone components used in this guide.

## Set up the Angular environment

Use the [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to set up your Angular application. The CLI requires Node.js v18 or later. To install the Angular CLI globally, run the following command:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## Create an Angular Application

1. Run the following Angular CLI command to create a new application:

    ```bash
    ng new my-app
    ```

2. When prompted for the stylesheet format, accept the default (CSS) or choose another option:

3. When prompted to enable Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG), select the appropriate configuration:

4. When prompted to configure AI tooling, select any preferred option based on the development workflow:

5. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd my-app
    ```

## Add Syncfusion<sup style="font-size:70%">&reg;</sup> Block Editor package

All Essential JS 2 packages are published in the [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/~syncfusionorg) registry. The `@syncfusion/ej2-angular-blockeditor` package supports Angular 14 and later. Install the Block Editor with the following command:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-angular-blockeditor
```

If you want to seed the editor with content programmatically, also install the model package:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-blockeditor
```

> If you see a peer-dependency warning for `@angular/core` after install, run `ng update` to align the CLI to the version targeted by the Block Editor package.

## Add a CSS reference

Syncfusion provides multiple themes for the Block Editor. For the full list, see the [themes packages](https://ej2.syncfusion.com/angular/documentation/appearance/overview#theme-packages) overview.

Install a Syncfusion theme package to provide the required styles. The following example installs the [Material 3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/ej2-material3-theme) theme:

```bash
npm install @syncfusion/ej2-material3-theme --save
```

To render the Block Editor, add the following import to your `src/styles.css` to load the editor's theme and dependency styles:

```css
@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-material3-theme/styles/blockeditor/index.css';
```

> If you use a CSS preprocessor or a custom build pipeline, ensure that the editor's CSS is bundled into the final stylesheet before deployment.

## Add the Block Editor component

Modify the template in `src/app/app.ts` (or `src/app/app.component.ts` for older Angular CLI versions) to render the Block Editor by using the `<ejs-blockeditor>` selector:

{% tabs %}
{% highlight ts tabtitle="app.ts" %}
{% include code-snippet/rich-text-editor-sdk/angular/block-editor/getting-started/src/app.ts %}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight css tabtitle="styles.css" %}
/* You can add global styles to this file, and also import other style files */
@import '../node_modules/@syncfusion/ej2-material3-theme/styles/blockeditor/index.css';
{% endhighlight %}
{% endtabs %}

{% previewsample "https://help.syncfusion.com/samples/rich-text-editor-sdk/angular/block-editor/getting-started" %}

> **Note:** Angular CLI 21 and later generates the root component as `src/app/app.ts`. Earlier Angular CLI versions use `src/app/app.component.ts`. The Block Editor's selector (`ejs-blockeditor`) is identical in both layouts.

## Run the application

Run the application in the browser using the following command:

```bash
ng serve --open
```
